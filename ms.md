# METHODS

## 2.1 Data collection

Overhead video footage of bottlenose dolphins was collected during regular survey efforts in the Patea-Doubtful and Tamatea-Dusky complex between February 2022 and November 2023. The Fiordland Marine Area is characterized by heavy rainfall (average ##m of rain each year), therefore, UAS flights were constrained to times when there was no rain, and low Beaufort (\<= Bft 2). Surveys were conducted from a 5-m vessel, and the UAS was launched and recovered by hand from the stern.

All UAS surveys were conducted using a DJI Inspire 1 Pro equipped with an Olympus 25mm f1.8 lens, and a custom-added laser altimeter system consisting of a LiDAR and Global Positioning System (GPS) data logger (see [@dawson2017] for details on the configuration). Flight altitude was targeted at 10-15m <!--# endash --> to comply with our permit issued by the New Zealand Department of Conservation (#87586-MAR), to obtain footage with a high enough resolution to identify individuals, and to also limit reaction to the platform by the animals. Video footage collected was shot in 4K resolution (2160 x 3840 pixels) at 25 frames per second; the animals move too quickly for single imagery to be practical.

## 2.2 Photogrammetry measurements

Video footage was reviewed using VLC player (REFERENCE) with SETTINGS <!--# include settings inc frame by frame-->. For application in total length and width measurements, screen captures were taken when an individual was in the most elongated position at the surface. This position was most often characterized by the frame where there was a clear view of the rostrum and tail notch slightly subsurface and the blowhole just above the surface (FIGURE reference). In addition, screen captures were taken in instances where the blowhole and dorsal fin insertion was clearly seen for application in exploring the allometric relationship between this length and total length as has been explored in previous studies (see REFERENCE). The time of the screen shot image was calculated by subtracting the time in the video from the timestamp of the video, and the altitude of the image was obtained by syncing this image timestamp to the feed from the LiDAR/GPS data logger.

Dolphins captured in image screen shots were scrutinized to identify the individual. Long-term photo-identification studies have occurred since 1990 on the Patea-Doubtful Sound population and since 2007 on the Tamatea-Dusky population (REFERENCE). These studies have primarily focused on the dorsal fin marks and scars to identify individuals, and for this study, the catalogue has been expanded to include oblique images of the entire dorsal body.
