## 1.1 Model specification

### 1.1.1 Cholesky decomposition

To improve computational efficiency in fitting the variance-covariance matrix $\Sigma$, the Cholesky formulation was used in our model. The Cholesky factor, $L$, is a positive-definite lower triangular matrix, which the functions in Stan [@stan] use to fit the model more efficiently. The variance-covariance matrix, $\Sigma$, is calculated by multiplying the correlation matrix ($L$ multiplied by its transpose, $L'$) by a diagonal matrix of standard deviations (the $i$th diagonal element is given by $\sigma_i$). That is,

\vspace{-3ex}

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\Sigma = \mathrm{diag}(\sigma) \times LL' \times \mathrm{diag}(\sigma).
\end{equation}
```
In our model, this formulation was implemented both for the variance-covariance matrices estimated for the four growth parameters ($\Sigma$) as well as for the measured total lengths ($\Sigma_{obs}$).

### 1.1.2 Non-centered parameterisation

Individual random effects can introduce issues with model fit under the centered-parameterisation. We experienced this when fitting our model, therefore, we implemented a non-centered paramaterisation with individual random effects. For the multivariate growth parameter model, $\boldsymbol{\theta_{i}}$, we introduced a vector of individual random effect parameters, $\boldsymbol{\zeta_i}$ = \[$\zeta_{L_{1i}}$, $\zeta_{k_{1i}}$, $\zeta_{L_{2i}}$, $\zeta_{k_{2i}}$\], and find

\vspace{-3ex}

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{\theta_i} = \boldsymbol{\mu} + \mathrm{diag}(\sigma) \times L \times \boldsymbol{\zeta_i},\; i = 1,\dotsc, n.
\end{equation}
```
The vector $\boldsymbol{\zeta_i}$ was assumed to come from a multivariate normal distribution with zero mean and identity variance matrix. The above formulations are equivalent to the log-normal and normal distributions detailed in Equation 2 in the main body of the text.

### 1.1.3 Priors

The parameters were given non-informative priors (Table S1). All $\mu$ parameters were from a normal distribution, and all $\sigma$ parameters were constrained to positive numbers from a student's t-distribution. We used a lognormal distribution for the prior distribution of $t_0$. The LKJ prior [@lewandowski2009] for both correlation matrices estimated in our model using the Cholesky formulation of the variance-covariance matrix ($\Sigma$) .

## 1.2 Conditional distribution

To further explore the relationships between pairs of growth parameters, we factored the multivariate normal model into its conditional distribution to explore linear relationships [@gelman1995bayesian, pg. 582]. Here we derive the conditional distribution of one (or more) of the $\boldsymbol{\theta_i}$ parameters, $y$, conditional on at least one of the other $\boldsymbol{\theta_i}$ parameters, $x$. The given value, $y$, is assumed to come from a normal distribution with the mean $\hat{y}$ and variance-covariance matrix, $\Sigma_{y|x}$ (Equation S4):

\vspace{-3ex}

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
y | x \sim \mathrm{N}(\hat{y}, {\Sigma_{y|x}}).
\end{equation}
```
The variance-covariance matrix of $\boldsymbol{\theta_i}$ can be defined as in the following (Equation S5):

\vspace{-3ex}

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
{\Sigma} = \left[\begin{array}{ccc}
\Sigma_{11} & \Sigma_{12} \\
\Sigma_{21} & \Sigma_{22}
\end{array}\right],
\end{equation}
```
where $\Sigma_{11}$ is the variance of $y$, $\Sigma_{22}$ is the variance of $x$, and $\Sigma_{21}$ = $\Sigma_{12}'$ gives the covariance between $x$ and $y$.

The expected value $\hat{y}$ is found according to (Equation S6) where $\mu_y$ and $\mu_x$ are the corresponding mean values from the $\boldsymbol{\mu}$ vector, and the $\Sigma$ subscripts correspond to locations within the block matrix:

\vspace{-3ex}

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\hat{y} = \mu_{y} + \Sigma_{12}\Sigma_{22}^{-1}(x - \mu_{x}).
\end{equation}
```
The conditional variance ${\Sigma_{y|x}}$ is:

\vspace{-3ex}

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\Sigma_{y|x} = \Sigma_{11} - \Sigma_{12}\Sigma_{22}^{-1}\Sigma_{21}.
\end{equation}
```
As an example, the conditional distribution between $L_{1i}$ and logit($k_{1i}$) in Fig. 3a of the main text are multivariate normal with mean $\underline{\mu}$ = \[$\mu_{L_1}$, $\mu_{k_1}$\] and variance:

\vspace{-3ex}

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\Sigma = \left[\begin{array}{ccc}
\sigma_{L_1}^2 & \rho_{L_{1}k_{1}}\sigma_{L_1}\sigma_{k_1} \\
\rho_{k_{1}L_{1}}\sigma_{k_1}\sigma_{L_1} & \sigma_{k_1}^2
\end{array}\right].
\end{equation}
```
The conditional distribution is

\vspace{-3ex}

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
L_{1i} | \mathrm{logit}(k_{1i}) \sim \mathrm{N}(\hat{L}_{1i}, \Sigma_{L_1 | k_1}).
\end{equation}
```
Using the posterior medians from Table S2, we find:

\vspace{-3ex}

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\hat{L}_{1i} & = \mu_{L_1} + \rho_{L_{1}k_{1i}}\sigma_{L_1}\sigma_{k_1} \times \frac{1}{\sigma_{k_1}^2} \times (\mathrm{logit}(k_{1i}) - \mu_{k_1}) \\
& = 2.737 + 0.271 \times \mathrm{logit}(k_{1i}),
\end{split}
\end{equation}
```
and the associated variance:

\vspace{-3ex}

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\Sigma_{L_1 | k_1} & = \sigma_{L_1}^2 - \rho_{L_{1}k_{1}}\sigma_{L_1}\sigma_{k_1} \times \frac{1}{\sigma_{k_1}^2} \times \rho_{k_{1}L_{1}}\sigma_{k_1}\sigma_{L_1} \\
& = 0.098.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
```

## 1.3 Model sensitivity to age assignments of unknown aged individuals

We re-ran our model with data where age was adjusted by an additional five and 10 years at each measurement occasion for 20 individuals not seen in their birth year (this excluded known reproductive females which already had an adjustment based on observed reproductive history). In the five year adjustment, results yielded slightly higher logit($k_{hi}$) estimates (Table S1.3.1) corresponding to slower growth rates (differences between median estimates of \< 0.035 on the logit scale). In the 10 year adjustment, growth estimates were also slower than the results from the five year adjustment, but at a lesser rate (Fig. S1.3.1). Both are expected results given the added time to reach the measured lengths. It is likely that an age adjustment is appropriate for some individuals in this group while others' ages will have been overestimated, but this is impossible to know given the available sighting histories. The five year age adjustment resulted in no major changes to the effects from pod and sex membership as the range of median estimates for the Doubtful pod and for females similarly encompassed the values from all other groups (Fig. S1.3.2). Overall, these modeled results yield minor differences from the results presented in the main text and our substantive conclusions are unchanged.

Table S1.3.1 Model estimates using data where five years were added to the age of unknown aged individuals (excluding reproductive females) at measurement occasions. Parameters include the the mean ($\mu$), standard deviation ($\sigma$), correlation ($\rho$), and hypothetical age less than zero when length was zero ($t_0$). The subscripts of the parameters are defined as follows: $L_1$ = maximum total length, $L_2$ = maximum blowhole to dorsal fin length, $k_1$ = logit-transformed growth rate of total length, and $k_2$ = logit-transformed growth rate of blowhole to dorsal fin length.

Our model used the Cholesky formulation to derive the variance-covariance matrix $\Sigma$ as this improved computational efficiency where parameter $L$ refers to the lower positive-definite triangular matrix of the correlation matrix. The LKJ prior with $\eta$ = 1 indicates there is no prior knowledge of an existence of correlation between parameters.

Note that there was no footage of the calibration object taken during the 2022_07 trip. A boat-hook wrapped in pool noodles was our known-length object as it was rigid, low-profile object that floated just above the surface. Two different length, contrasting coloured noodles (purple and orange) on one fully extended boat-hook allowed for measurements of three varying lengths (total length of both colours together, 1.947 m, and two shorter lengths of each of the sections to represent smaller individuals, 1.485 m and 0.462 m). Calibration flights occurred at similar altitudes that were flown over dolphins for data collection (mean: 17.1 m, range: 12.8--24.5 m).
