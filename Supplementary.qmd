## 1.1 Model specification

### 1.1.1 Cholesky decomposition

To improve computational efficiency in fitting the variance-covariance matrix $\Sigma$, the Cholesky formulation was used in our model. The Cholesky factor, $L$, is a positive-definite lower triangular matrix, which the functions in Stan [@stan] use to fit the model more efficiently. The variance-covariance matrix, $\Sigma$, is calculated by multiplying the correlation matrix ($L$ multiplied by its transpose, $L'$) by a diagonal matrix of standard deviations (the $i$th diagonal element is given by $\sigma_i$). That is,

\vspace{-3ex}

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\Sigma = \mathrm{diag}(\sigma) \times LL' \times \mathrm{diag}(\sigma).
\end{equation}
```
In our model, this formulation was implemented both for the variance-covariance matrices estimated for the four growth parameters ($\Sigma$) as well as for the measured total lengths ($\Sigma_{obs}$).

### 1.1.2 Non-centered parameterisation

Individual random effects can introduce issues with model fit under the centered-parameterisation. We experienced this when fitting our model, therefore, we implemented a non-centered paramaterisation with individual random effects. For the multivariate growth parameter model, $\boldsymbol{\theta_{i}}$, we introduced a vector of individual random effect parameters, $\boldsymbol{\zeta_i}$ = \[$\zeta_{L_{1i}}$, $\zeta_{k_{1i}}$, $\zeta_{L_{2i}}$, $\zeta_{k_{2i}}$\], and find

\vspace{-3ex}

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{\theta_i} = \boldsymbol{\mu} + \mathrm{diag}(\sigma) \times L \times \boldsymbol{\zeta_i},\; i = 1,\dotsc, n.
\end{equation}
```
The vector $\boldsymbol{\zeta_i}$ was assumed to come from a multivariate normal distribution with zero mean and identity variance matrix. The above formulations are equivalent to the log-normal and normal distributions detailed in Equation 2 in the main body of the text.

### 1.1.3 Priors

The parameters were given non-informative priors (Table S1). All $\mu$ parameters were from a normal distribution, and all $\sigma$ parameters were constrained to positive numbers from a student's t-distribution. We used a lognormal distribution for the prior distribution of $t_0$. The LKJ prior [@lewandowski2009] for both correlation matrices estimated in our model using the Cholesky formulation of the variance-covariance matrix ($\Sigma$) .

## 1.2 Conditional distribution

To further explore the relationships between pairs of growth parameters, we factored the multivariate normal model into its conditional distribution to explore linear relationships [@gelman1995bayesian, pg. 582]. Here we derive the conditional distribution of one (or more) of the $\boldsymbol{\theta_i}$ parameters, $y$, conditional on at least one of the other $\boldsymbol{\theta_i}$ parameters, $x$. The given value, $y$, is assumed to come from a normal distribution with the mean $\hat{y}$ and variance-covariance matrix, $\Sigma_{y|x}$ (Equation S4):

\vspace{-3ex}

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
y | x \sim \mathrm{N}(\hat{y}, {\Sigma_{y|x}}).
\end{equation}
```
The variance-covariance matrix of $\boldsymbol{\theta_i}$ can be defined as in the following (Equation S5):

\vspace{-3ex}

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
{\Sigma} = \left[\begin{array}{ccc}
\Sigma_{11} & \Sigma_{12} \\
\Sigma_{21} & \Sigma_{22}
\end{array}\right],
\end{equation}
```
where $\Sigma_{11}$ is the variance of $y$, $\Sigma_{22}$ is the variance of $x$, and $\Sigma_{21}$ = $\Sigma_{12}'$ gives the covariance between $x$ and $y$.

The expected value $\hat{y}$ is found according to (Equation S6) where $\mu_y$ and $\mu_x$ are the corresponding mean values from the $\boldsymbol{\mu}$ vector, and the $\Sigma$ subscripts correspond to locations within the block matrix:

\vspace{-3ex}

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\hat{y} = \mu_{y} + \Sigma_{12}\Sigma_{22}^{-1}(x - \mu_{x}).
\end{equation}
```
The conditional variance ${\Sigma_{y|x}}$ is:

\vspace{-3ex}

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\Sigma_{y|x} = \Sigma_{11} - \Sigma_{12}\Sigma_{22}^{-1}\Sigma_{21}.
\end{equation}
```
As an example, the conditional distribution between $L_{1i}$ and logit($k_{1i}$) in Fig. 3a of the main text are multivariate normal with mean $\underline{\mu}$ = \[$\mu_{L_1}$, $\mu_{k_1}$\] and variance:

\vspace{-3ex}

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\Sigma = \left[\begin{array}{ccc}
\sigma_{L_1}^2 & \rho_{L_{1}k_{1}}\sigma_{L_1}\sigma_{k_1} \\
\rho_{k_{1}L_{1}}\sigma_{k_1}\sigma_{L_1} & \sigma_{k_1}^2
\end{array}\right].
\end{equation}
```
The conditional distribution is

\vspace{-3ex}

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
L_{1i} | \mathrm{logit}(k_{1i}) \sim \mathrm{N}(\hat{L}_{1i}, \Sigma_{L_1 | k_1}).
\end{equation}
```
Using the posterior medians from Table S2, we find:

\vspace{-3ex}

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\hat{L}_{1i} & = \mu_{L_1} + \rho_{L_{1}k_{1i}}\sigma_{L_1}\sigma_{k_1} \times \frac{1}{\sigma_{k_1}^2} \times (\mathrm{logit}(k_{1i}) - \mu_{k_1}) \\
& = 2.737 + 0.271 \times \mathrm{logit}(k_{1i}),
\end{split}
\end{equation}
```
and the associated variance:

\vspace{-3ex}

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\Sigma_{L_1 | k_1} & = \sigma_{L_1}^2 - \rho_{L_{1}k_{1}}\sigma_{L_1}\sigma_{k_1} \times \frac{1}{\sigma_{k_1}^2} \times \rho_{k_{1}L_{1}}\sigma_{k_1}\sigma_{L_1} \\
& = 0.098.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
```

Our model used the Cholesky formulation to derive the variance-covariance matrix $\Sigma$ as this improved computational efficiency where parameter $L$ refers to the lower positive-definite triangular matrix of the correlation matrix. The LKJ prior with $\eta$ = 1 indicates there is no prior knowledge of an existence of correlation between parameters.

Model parameter estimates of the expanded model exploring sex ($\beta$)- and pod ($\gamma$)-effects, including the probability of an individual being male ($\pi$), the mean ($\mu$), standard deviation ($\sigma$), correlation ($\rho$), and theoretical age less than zero when length was zero ($t_0$).

Note that there was no footage of the calibration object taken during the 2022_07 trip. A boat-hook wrapped in pool noodles was our known-length object as it was rigid, low-profile object that floated just above the surface. Two different length, contrasting coloured noodles (purple and orange) on one fully extended boat-hook allowed for measurements of three varying lengths (total length of both colours together, 1.947 m, and two shorter lengths of each of the sections to represent smaller individuals, 1.485 m and 0.462 m). Calibration flights occurred at similar altitudes that were flown over dolphins for data collection (mean: 17.1 m, range: 12.8--24.5 m).
