FIGURE CAPTIONS

Figure 1. Example measurement snapshot where the rostrum and fluke notch are clearly visible for total length (TL), and the blowhole and dorsal fin insertion (BHDF) are above the surface for the BHDF measurement. Oblique photos are also provided to demonstrate how individuals were identified from dorsal body markings. The animal in this image is a reproductive female named 'Minus' born in 2006.

Figure 2. (a) Von Bertalanffy growth curves (VBGC) of total length (TL) and blowhole to dorsal fin length (BHDF) from median estimates for each individual. The horizontal red lines are the median (solid) and 90% credible intervals (CI; dashed) of the population-level posterior distribution. (b) The individual TL VBGC relative to birth year ('actual' = birth year if known; 'est' = first year sighted or estimated based on calving history). (c) The uncertainty (90%CI, vertical lines) around the median maximum total length estimates (points) for each individual; the position within the year bin is arbitrary.

Figure 3. (a--c) The conditional distribution (red line, listed equation) between growth parameters where $\hat{y}$ is the expected value of one parameter given another, x. The individual $i$ growth parameters (black dots) are maximum length $L_{hi}$ and growth rate (logit($k_{hi}$)) where $h$ = 1 is the total length and $h$ = 2 is the blowhole to dorsal fin length. The dashed red lines indicate the standard deviations ($\sigma$) of the conditional distribution.

Figure 4. Exploratory summary boxplots of the growth rates (logit($k_{hi}$) and maximum total length ($L_{hi}$) median estimates where $h$ = 1 is the total length and $h$ = 2 is the blowhole to dorsal fin length. Each individual $i$ is grouped by (a) sex (F = female, M = male, X = unknown) and (b) pod membership. Note that the y-axis is in meters for $L_{hi}$.
