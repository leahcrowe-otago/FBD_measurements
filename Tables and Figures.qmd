Fig. 1. Map of the Patea-Doubtful (yellow) and the Tamatea-Dusky (purple) complexes in southwestern Aotearoa-New Zealand a. relative to Ata Whenua-Fiordland National Park (green) and the Te Moana o Atawhenua-Fiordland Marine Area (all areas of the sea inshore of the teal line including all fiords), and b. closer details. The 50m (grey) and 200m (dark blue) isobaths are provided on both maps. $\mathrm{\bar{O}}$tepoti-Dunedin is marked as the red dot on the small inset map.

Fig. 2. Example video snapshot where the rostrum and fluke notch are clearly visible for the total length (TL) measurements, and the blowhole and dorsal fin insertion are above the surface (BHDF). Oblique photos are also provided to demonstrate how individuals were identified from dorsal body markings. The animal in this image is a reproductive female named 'Minus' born in 2006.

```{r, Fig_raw, echo = F, out.height = '60%'}

```

Fig. 3. Measured values of total length (solid circles) and blowhole to dorsal fin length (open circles).

```{r, Fig_hist, echo = F, out.height='80%'}
knitr::include_graphics('./Figures/hist_fig.png')

```

Fig. 4. Number of snapshots where an individual dolphin measurement of TL and/or BHDF was taken per pod identity a. over the course of the entire study and b. per sampling effort.

```

Fig. 5. Predicted von Bertalanffy growth curves for each individual measured. Curves were fit using the median values estimated for $Ly_{i}$ and $ky_{i}$, and are a. plotted relative to age and b. actual (solid lines) or estimated minimum (dotted lines) birth year.

```{r, Fig_Ly_CI, echo = F, out.width='110%'}
knitr::include_graphics('./Figures/Ly_CI.png')
```

Fig. 6. Posterior distribution estimate of total length for each individual ($Ly_{i}$) by actual or estimated minimum birth year. The plotted point is at the median estimate and the vertical lines represent the 90% credible intervals. The x-axis indicates the animal's birth year bin; the position within the year bin is arbitrarily spaced to be able to see the points.

```{r, Fig_box, echo = F, out.height='80%'}
knitr::include_graphics('./Figures/boxplots.png')
```

Fig. 7. Exploratory summary boxplots of the median estimates of growth rate (logit($ky_i$), left column) and estimated maximum total length ($Ly_{i}$, right column) calculated for each individual grouped by a. sex (F = female, M = male, X = unknown) and b. pod membership. Note the y-axis for logit($ky_i$) is the estimated growth rate ($e^K$) and is meters for $Ly$.
